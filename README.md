# deckforge
Deckforge is a python package that serves as the API/backend for minting Jacob Sanford's Happy Goodtimes digital trading cards into a local blockchain. It provides functionality for minting, transferring, and querying cards, as well as creating wallets to store them. The package is designed to be used in conjunction with the `deckforge-ui` package, which provides a user interface for interacting with the blockchain.

## Storage
The blockchain is stored in a json file.
